# PRIZM Technical Analysis Module – User Guide

## Overview
![Placeholder - Overview](technical-analysis/img/)

The **Technical Analysis** module is a core engineering governance component within the PRIZM ENERGY ERP Admin Portal. It provides a structured framework for performing, documenting, reviewing, and approving technical evaluations related to projects, opportunities, vendors, and engineering decisions.

A Technical Analysis record represents a formal technical assessment used to validate feasibility, compliance, risks, scope alignment, and engineering soundness before critical business or project decisions are finalized. The module ensures transparency, traceability, and accountability across engineering and management teams.

Technical Analysis supports:
- Engineering validation and design compliance  
- Risk identification and mitigation  
- Technical decision justification  
- Cross-department alignment  
- Audit and compliance requirements
