# PRIZM RFQ Module – User Guide

## Overview

The **RFQ (Requests for Quotation)** module in PRIZM ENERGY ERP manages the full procurement quotation lifecycle, from internal request creation through supplier invitation, quotation collection, evaluation, approval, and final award. It ensures a transparent, auditable, and structured approach to supplier selection and cost control.

RFQs act as the formal bridge between internal demand (projects, budgets, operational needs) and external suppliers.
